An implementation of the Kanagawa theme for Rstudio.

## Installation

Download the `kanagawa.rstheme` file from the repository and save it into a folder of your choice.

Then, within RStudio, open the settings page, go to the appearance tab and choose the "Add..." option located below the "Editor theme:" box.

Go to the folder you chose before and select the `kanagawa.rstheme` file.

## Features

This theme implements the Kanagawa wave color palette from the [kanagawa.nvim repository](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file) into RStudio.

It changes the colors for the IDE's main panels, as well as for the terminal itself. Additionally, it chages the colors from the default dark theme so that it fits the Kanagawa color palette.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement the `dragon` palette.
- [ ] Implement the `lotus` palette.
